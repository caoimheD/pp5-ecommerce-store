### Feature testing

Feature testing was done manually by going through each feature and ensuring it works as intended. Below are details of this manual testing:

Homepage

| Action        | Expected Behaviour  | Result | 
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | 
| Enter url of site in browser  | site shows homepage | pass |

### Validator testing

HTML validator testing passed (https://validator.w3.org/)

![HTML](static/media/htmlpp4.jpg "HTML")

CSS validator testing passed (https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

![CSS](static/media/csspp4.jpg "CSS")

Python testing was done in Gitpod, with errors showing a red underscore and also in the 'problems' tab. These could then be easily corrected as they arose. Currently there are no issues in the 'problems' tab and no errors showing on any of the pages.
